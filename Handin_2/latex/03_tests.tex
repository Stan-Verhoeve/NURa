\section{Various tests for routines}
During the programming of this hand-in, I have tested my implementations on known cases. These tests include integrating functions with known anti-derivative (both closed and open), subjecting random number generation to a Pearson correlation test, as well as finding the expectation value and variance, and finding known roots of simple functions. The full code is given below:
